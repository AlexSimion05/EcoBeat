        <h2>Who we are:<h2></h2>
        <p>This project serves as an incentive to motivate various individuals to become more environmentally aware. We’re a small group of individuals looking to turn this learning process into a fun experience. We plan on having redeemable rewards as a trade-in for completed tasks. These tasks pertain to lowering our environmental footprint including- proper recycling, composting, reducing our energy consumption, and being conscious of all that we waste.</p>
